## Introduction

As a business owner, I need a user-friendly platform to effortlessly oversee and organize my company's departments, roles, and employees. This will enable me to efficiently plan and strategize for the growth and success of my business.

## Usage

Upon starting the command-line, users are presented with a menu offering various options: viewing all departments, roles, and employees, adding a department, role, or employee, and updating an employee's role. Upon selecting to view departments, a formatted table displaying department names and IDs is presented. Likewise, choosing to view roles provides details like job title, role ID, associated department, and salary. Opting to view employees showcases a formatted table containing employee IDs, first and last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and their respective managers. Adding a department prompts for its name, adding it to the database upon input. Similarly, adding a role requires entering its name, salary, and department, while adding an employee prompts for first name, last name, role, and manager details. Lastly, updating an employee's role involves selecting the employee and specifying their new role, with the database being updated accordingly.
